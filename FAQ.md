# GCOSL Frequently Asked Questions

---

## General

### What is GCOSL?

GCOSL is the Gideon Christian Open Source License. It is a source-available license that permits non-commercial use of the software while reserving all commercial rights to Gideon Solutions LLC and prohibiting specific categories of harmful use.

### Is GCOSL an open-source license?

GCOSL is source-available but not OSI-approved. The source code is publicly readable and usable for non-commercial purposes, but the license places restrictions on use that do not meet the Open Source Definition. This is by design.

### Why does the license have moral restrictions?

Because software is infrastructure, and infrastructure shapes what is possible. GCOSL reflects the position that the people who build tools bear some responsibility for how those tools are used. The restrictions are not symbolic. They are enforceable terms.

## Permitted Uses

### Is academic research allowed?

Yes, provided the research itself does not fall within a prohibited use category. A university studying database performance may use GCOSL-licensed software. A university building a mass surveillance prototype may not — regardless of whether it is called "research."

The distinction is not between academic and non-academic. It is between permitted and prohibited purposes.

### Is journalism allowed?

Yes. Journalists may use GCOSL-licensed software for reporting, investigation, and publication. Journalism is a non-commercial, public-interest activity in this context.

However, if a media organization is using the software as part of a for-profit commercial product or service, that constitutes commercial use and requires written permission from Gideon Solutions LLC.

### Is government use allowed?

It depends on which part of the government and for what purpose.

A public health department using the software to manage clinic scheduling — permitted, assuming it is non-commercial and does not involve prohibited activities.

A military agency, intelligence service, or law enforcement entity engaged in surveillance, weapons logistics, or military operations — prohibited, without exception.

Government use is not categorically allowed or disallowed. It is evaluated against the same rules as any other use.

### Can nonprofits use this software?

Yes. Nonprofit, charitable, humanitarian, and religious organizations may use GCOSL-licensed software for their operations. This is explicitly permitted under the Non-Commercial Use grant.

The same prohibited use restrictions apply. A nonprofit may not use the software for a prohibited purpose simply because it is a nonprofit.

### Can startups use this software?

A startup is a for-profit entity. Use of GCOSL-licensed software by a startup in its business operations, products, or services constitutes commercial use. Commercial use requires explicit written permission from Gideon Solutions LLC.

A founder studying the source code for personal learning is engaged in personal, non-commercial use — that is permitted.

### Can I use this software for a personal project?

Yes. Personal, non-commercial use is permitted. You may use, modify, and share the software for personal purposes, provided you comply with the license terms and do not engage in any prohibited use.

### Can I use this for my church, mosque, synagogue, or religious community?

Yes. Religious ministry is explicitly listed as a permitted non-commercial use. This applies to all religious communities, not only Christian ones.

## Prohibited Uses

### What if my use is legal in my country?

Legality in your jurisdiction does not override the license. GCOSL's prohibited use restrictions apply regardless of local law. If your jurisdiction permits an activity that GCOSL prohibits, the license still forbids it.

### What about "defensive" military use?

There is no exception for defensive use. The prohibition on military, paramilitary, and mercenary activities applies to all military use — offensive, defensive, logistical, training, or otherwise.

### What about security research?

Security research that does not involve a prohibited use category is permitted. Testing the software for vulnerabilities, reporting bugs, and improving security are legitimate non-commercial activities.

Security research conducted by or for an intelligence agency, surveillance organization, or military entity is prohibited — not because it is research, but because of who is conducting it and for what ultimate purpose.

### What about dual-use technology?

GCOSL does not recognize a "dual-use" exception. If a use falls within a prohibited category, it is prohibited. The fact that the same software could also be used for a permitted purpose does not create a right to use it for a prohibited one.

### Does the gambling prohibition include all games?

No. The prohibition targets gambling platforms, casinos, sports betting systems, lotteries operated for private profit, and predatory financial schemes. It does not prohibit games, entertainment software, or contests that do not involve wagering or predatory financial mechanics.

## Commercial Use

### How do I get commercial permission?

Contact Gideon Solutions LLC directly. Commercial licensing requires a written agreement signed by an authorized representative of Gideon Solutions LLC. The agreement must specify the scope, duration, and conditions of the permitted commercial use.

### Can I use this in a SaaS product?

Operating a software-as-a-service product is commercial use. It requires written permission from Gideon Solutions LLC.

### Can I use this in internal business tools?

Use of the software in internal operations of a for-profit business constitutes commercial use. It requires written permission from Gideon Solutions LLC.

## Distribution and Modification

### Can I fork this software?

You may create derivative works for non-commercial use. All derivative works must be distributed under the same GCOSL license, unmodified. You may not remove, alter, or weaken the license terms in a fork.

### Can I contribute to GCOSL-licensed projects?

Contribution policies are set by individual projects that use GCOSL, not by the license itself. The license governs use and distribution. Project maintainers define their own contribution processes.

### Can I relicense a derivative work?

No. Derivative works must be distributed under GCOSL. You may not relicense GCOSL-licensed software or derivative works under a different license.

---

## Usury and Finance

### Is all interest prohibited?

Yes. GCOSL prohibits the use of the software to facilitate any lending arrangement that guarantees the lender a return on principal. This applies regardless of the interest rate — whether 1% or 30%, whether labeled "low-interest," "market-rate," or "microfinance." The prohibition is structural: if the lender is guaranteed a return and bears no risk of loss, the arrangement is prohibited.

### Are banks allowed to use this?

A bank or financial institution that uses GCOSL-licensed software to facilitate interest-bearing loans is in violation of the license. A bank or financial institution that uses the software exclusively for permitted activities — such as profit-sharing arrangements, equity participation, payment processing unrelated to interest-bearing lending, or other operations that do not involve prohibited uses — may use the software for those permitted purposes.

The distinction is not the type of institution. It is the type of activity.

### Is staking allowed?

Yes, provided the staking mechanism involves genuine shared risk. Participation in blockchain validation, decentralized consensus protocols, or equivalent systems where the participant's capital is genuinely at risk and returns are not guaranteed is explicitly permitted under Section 4.11.2(e) of the license.

Staking arrangements that are structured to guarantee a fixed return — regardless of what they are called — are prohibited.

### Are profit-sharing and equity investments allowed?

Yes. GCOSL explicitly permits profit-sharing arrangements, revenue-sharing agreements, equity participation, and dividends based on actual performance. The common requirement is that the capital provider shares in real risk and real outcomes, rather than extracting a guaranteed return regardless of what happens to the borrower.

### Can I build a lending platform?

You may build a lending platform that facilitates interest-free lending or risk-sharing finance. You may not build a platform that facilitates interest-bearing loans, regardless of the rate or the borrower population.

### Can inflation adjustment be applied to loans?

Yes, under strict conditions. Interest-free loans may include repayment adjusted for inflation, but the adjustment must not guarantee profit, must not exceed measured inflation, must not be set at the lender's discretion, and must be based on a transparent, publicly auditable inflation index approved through Gideon governance. Any mechanism that functions as a guaranteed return — regardless of its label — is prohibited.

### Is this anti-capitalist?

No. GCOSL does not oppose capital, enterprise, investment, or commerce. It opposes a specific financial structure: the extraction of guaranteed, risk-free return from the act of lending. The permitted alternatives — profit-sharing, equity participation, revenue-sharing, performance-based dividends — are all forms of capital deployment. They simply require the capital provider to share in the real outcomes of what they fund.

This is not a rejection of markets. It is a constraint on one specific mechanism within markets that GCOSL identifies as inherently exploitative.

## Philosophy

### Is this anti-technology?

No. GCOSL governs the use of software that Gideon Solutions LLC builds and releases. It is pro-technology in the sense that it encourages the creation and sharing of useful tools. It is restrictive only in the sense that it refuses to permit those tools to be used for purposes that degrade human life.

Restraint is not opposition. Building a bridge with guardrails is not anti-bridge.

### Why Christian ethics specifically?

Because that is the ethical tradition of the license's author and the organization that maintains it. The license is transparent about its moral grounding rather than pretending to be value-neutral.

The license does not require users to hold Christian beliefs. It requires them to comply with its terms. Those terms happen to be informed by a specific ethical tradition, which is stated openly.

### Is this enforceable?

GCOSL is a copyright license. It grants rights under specific conditions. Violation of those conditions constitutes copyright infringement, which is enforceable under the laws of the United States and international copyright treaties. The governing jurisdiction is North Carolina.

Enforceability of specific provisions may vary by jurisdiction, but the license includes a severability clause: if one provision is found unenforceable in a given jurisdiction, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
