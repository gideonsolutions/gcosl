# GCOSL Governance

## Purpose

This document defines how the Gideon Christian Open Source License (GCOSL) is maintained, who has authority to modify it, and what principles govern its evolution.

GCOSL is designed for stability. It is not a living document that shifts with trends, public pressure, or commercial convenience. Changes to the license are rare, deliberate, and subject to strict constraints.

---

## Authority

### Sole Maintainer

[Gideon Solutions, LLC](https://www.gideonsolutions.us/) is the sole maintainer and copyright holder of GCOSL. All authority to modify, version, interpret, or retire the license rests exclusively with Gideon Solutions, LLC.

No external organization, standards body, open-source foundation, or community vote may alter the terms of GCOSL.

### Authorized Representatives

Only individuals explicitly authorized in writing by Gideon Solutions, LLC may propose, draft, or approve changes to GCOSL. Authorization is not transferable and may be revoked at any time.

## Principles of Governance

### 1. Restrictions Are Intentional

Every prohibition in GCOSL exists by design. The prohibited use categories in Section 4 of the license were not drafted carelessly or included as defaults. They reflect deliberate moral commitments.

No party — including Gideon Solutions, LLC itself — may remove, narrow, weaken, or introduce exceptions to any existing prohibition. Future versions of GCOSL may add new prohibited use categories or strengthen existing ones, but may never reduce the scope of any prohibition present in a prior version. This constraint is structural and irrevocable. It survives any change of ownership, acquisition, or reorganization of Gideon Solutions, LLC.

### 2. Stability Over Responsiveness

GCOSL prioritizes long-term moral consistency over rapid adaptation. The license is not versioned on a release schedule. New versions are issued only when a substantive change is necessary and has been thoroughly reviewed.

Minor clarifications that do not alter the meaning or scope of the license may be issued as errata without a version increment.

### 3. No Erosion by Precedent

The fact that a particular use was previously tolerated, overlooked, or not enforced does not create a right to that use. Non-enforcement is not approval. GCOSL may be enforced at any time against any violation, regardless of prior history.

### 4. No Weakening by Fork

If a third party forks a GCOSL-licensed project and removes or modifies the license terms, that fork is in violation of GCOSL. Derivative works of software must carry the same license, unmodified. A fork that strips restrictions is not a permitted derivative — it is a breach.

### 5. Derivative Licenses Under Approval

GCOSL permits the creation of derivative licenses — new license documents based on GCOSL — for use by other organizations in their own software. This is governed by Section 14 of the license and requires explicit written approval from Gideon Solutions, LLC.

The governing constraint is the mandatory prohibition floor: every prohibited use category in Section 4 must be preserved at full scope and strength in any Derivative License. Derivative licensors may add new prohibitions or strengthen existing ones, but may never weaken, remove, or create exceptions to any existing prohibition.

Gideon Solutions, LLC reviews all Derivative License applications and reserves the right to deny approval or revoke it if the conditions are violated. This process exists to encourage the broader Christian community to build on GCOSL's ethical foundation while ensuring that foundation is never compromised.

### 6. Transparency of Changes

All changes to GCOSL will be documented with:

- The version number of the new license text.
- The date of the change.
- A plain-English summary of what changed and why.
- The full text of the previous version, preserved in the repository history.

Changes will not be made silently or retroactively.

## Amendment Process

1. **Proposal.** A proposed change must be submitted in writing to an authorized representative of Gideon Solutions, LLC at [ian@gideonsolutions.us](mailto:ian@gideonsolutions.us). The proposal must state the specific language to be changed and the reason for the change.

2. **Review.** The proposal will be reviewed by Gideon Solutions, LLC. There is no fixed timeline for review. Review may include consultation with legal counsel, ethical advisors, or other parties at the sole discretion of Gideon Solutions, LLC.

3. **Decision.** Gideon Solutions, LLC will accept, reject, or modify the proposal. The decision is final and not subject to appeal.

4. **Publication.** Accepted changes will be published as a new version of GCOSL with accompanying documentation as described above.

## What This Governance Does Not Do

- It does not create a committee, board, or external review body.
- It does not grant any external party veto power over license changes.
- It does not obligate Gideon Solutions, LLC to accept contributions, feedback, or amendments from any source.
- It does not establish a democratic or consensus-based process for license modification.

GCOSL is maintained by its creator. This is not a weakness. It is a safeguard against dilution.
