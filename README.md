# Gideon Christian Open Source License (GCOSL)

## What This Is

GCOSL is a source-available software license created by [Gideon Solutions, LLC](https://www.gideonsolutions.us/). It governs how software released by Gideon may be used, modified, and distributed.

This repository contains the license text itself and its supporting documentation. It is not a product. It is the legal and ethical foundation that Gideon software references.

## What "Open Source" Means Here

GCOSL is **source-available**, not permissive. The source code of software released under GCOSL is publicly readable and available for non-commercial use. However, GCOSL is not an OSI-approved license and does not follow the Open Source Definition's requirement of unrestricted use.

This is intentional. GCOSL places moral and legal boundaries on how software may be used. These boundaries exist because unrestricted use is not the same as responsible use.

## What GCOSL Allows

- **Personal use.** You may use GCOSL-licensed software for your own purposes.
- **Education.** Students, teachers, and academic institutions may use the software for study and instruction.
- **Nonprofit work.** Charitable, humanitarian, and religious organizations may use the software in their operations.
- **Modification.** You may create derivative works for any permitted non-commercial purpose.
- **Distribution.** You may share the software and derivative works, provided they remain under this same license.

## What GCOSL Reserves

All commercial use is reserved exclusively to Gideon Solutions, LLC. If you want to use GCOSL-licensed software commercially, you need explicit written permission from Gideon Solutions, LLC.

## What GCOSL Prohibits

The following uses are prohibited absolutely, for all users, in all jurisdictions, without exception:

- Pornography or sexual exploitation
- Prostitution or sex trafficking
- Human trafficking or forced labor
- Production, distribution, or sale of illegal drugs
- Manufacture, sale, or distribution of weapons or armaments
- Military, paramilitary, or mercenary activities
- Intelligence services, intelligence agencies, or surveillance organizations
- Mass surveillance or population profiling
- Violence, coercion, or physical harm
- Gambling or predatory financial schemes
- Usury or interest-bearing lending (risk-sharing finance such as profit-sharing, equity participation, and performance-based returns is permitted)

These prohibitions have no exceptions. They cannot be circumvented by characterizing use as "research," "defensive," "dual-use," or "where legal." The restrictions apply to everyone, including governments, nonprofits, and academic institutions.

## Why These Restrictions Exist

GCOSL is grounded in Christian ethical principles: the dignity of the human person, honesty in labor, and restraint of power. These principles shape the license, but the license does not require religious belief. You do not need to be a Christian to use GCOSL-licensed software. You need to comply with its terms.

The restrictions exist because software is not neutral. Code that processes transactions, manages data, or coordinates logistics can serve good ends or destructive ones. GCOSL draws a line. It is a refusal to be complicit in uses that degrade, exploit, or destroy human life.

This is not a political statement. It is a structural decision about what kind of work this software will and will not do.

## Derivative Licenses

GCOSL encourages fellow Christians and like-minded organizations to build on this ethical foundation for their own software and businesses. With explicit written approval from Gideon Solutions, LLC, you may create a derivative license based on GCOSL that names your own organization and adapts the commercial and jurisdictional terms to your context.

The one non-negotiable requirement: **every prohibition in GCOSL must be preserved at full strength.** You may add new restrictions or strengthen existing ones, but you may never weaken, remove, or create exceptions to any prohibited use category. See Section 14 of the license for the full terms.
